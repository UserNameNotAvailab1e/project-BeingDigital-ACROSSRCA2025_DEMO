# The Nostalgia Broker
> "The automobile is dead. We re-forge the soul."

## 1. Project Overview: What is this?
**The Nostalgia Broker** is a speculative design prototype that imagines a future where the physical act of driving no longer exists. Instead, the profound sensory experience of operating a machine—the roar of the engine, the danger of speed, the vibration of the chassis—has been commodified into tradeable digital assets.

We chose this concept to explore the **"Ghost in the Machine"**: how human memory and emotion can be packaged, sold, and consumed in a hyper-digital age. The interface uses **"Unstable Brutalism"**—a stark, glitch-heavy aesthetic—to represent the decaying nature of these memories and the volatility of the market.

## 2. Meet the Team
This project is a collaborative fusion of narrative, design, and technology.

*   **David** (System Architecture): Built the logic that drives the "soul" of the machine.
*   **Florence** (Documentation): Captured the physical reality to ground our digital dreams.
*   **Haoyu Xue** (Narrative & Design): Wove the story of the post-automotive world and defined the visual language.
*   **Harry** (Domain Expertise): Provided the deep automotive knowledge that makes the simulation feel authentic.
*   **Vaibhav** (Game Design): Crafted the interactive flow to feel like a high-stakes game.

## 3. The Experience: A 5-Stage Walkthrough
Here is a guide to the interface elements to help the team understand the user flow.

### Phase 1: Attraction (The Handshake)
![Phase 1: Attraction](./public/screenshots/phase_1_attraction.png)
*   **The Pulsing Circle**: This isn't just a button; it's a **Biometric Scanner**. It represents the machine "tasting" the user's biological signature.
*   **"System Restricted"**: Tells the user they are entering a controlled, high-stakes environment.
*   **Interaction**: The user must click precisely on the "heartbeat" to prove they are human and initiate the connection.

### Phase 2: Configuration (The Negotiation)
![Phase 2: Configuration](./public/screenshots/phase_2_config.png)
*   **The Sliders**: These allow the user to mix the "ingredients" of their memory:
    *   **Aural/Noise**: How loud and chaotic is the memory?
    *   **Danger/Risk**: How close to death does the memory feel?
    *   **Inefficiency/Mechanical**: How raw and unpolished is the engine vibration?
*   **The Cost Index**: The numbers on the right. As you increase the intensity (more danger, more noise), the "price" of the memory goes up. It fluctuates like a stock market ticker.
*   **The Warning**: If you push the sliders too high (>80%), the system warns you of "Neural Overload"—it's a safety breaker for the user's mind.

### Phase 3: Trigger (The Glitch)
![Phase 3: Trigger](./public/screenshots/phase_3_trigger.png)
*   **Visual Chaos**: The screen shakes and text scrambles. This represents the **"Upload"** process.
*   **Status Messages**: "DESYNC," "INJECTING," "LOCKED." These showcase the unstable connection between the human brain and the digital server.
*   **Purpose**: To build tension before the "drop."

### Phase 4: Consumption (The High)
![Phase 4: Consumption](./public/screenshots/phase_4_consumption.png)
*   **The Feed**: A simulated video stream (abstract shapes/noise) representing the raw data being downloaded into the user's cortex.
*   **HUD Overlay**: "NEURAL: LINKED." Shows that the transaction is active and the user is "consuming" the product.

### Phase 5: Receipt (The Proof)
![Phase 5: Receipt](./public/screenshots/phase_5_receipt.png)
*   **The Ticket**: A physical-looking digital receipt. It creates a sense of permanence in a temporary experience.
*   **NFM Token**: "Non-Fungible Memory." A play on NFTs, satirizing how we try to own feelings.
*   **QR Code**: Allows the user to "take" the memory with them, bridging the digital and physical worlds.

## 4. Technology Stack
*   **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript (For robust, type-safe logic)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (For rapid, atomic styling)
*   **Animation**: Framer Motion (For the complex, fluid transitions)
*   **State**: Zustand (To manage the global "Soul" of the application)
