# The Nostalgia Broker

> "The automobile is dead. We re-forge the soul."

A speculative service design prototype simulating a high-frequency trading terminal for intangible assets. This application allows users to configure and trade simulated "driving memories" through an unstable, brutalist interface.

## Concept
The application explores the commodification of sensory experiences in a post-automotive future. It features a 5-stage critical design flow:
1.  **Attraction**: Biological Identity Verification.
2.  **Configuration**: Asset customization (Auditory, Risk, Mechanical).
3.  **Transaction**: Value assessment and ethical confirmation.
4.  **Processing**: Neural path generation (Hallucination).
5.  **Receipt**: Non-Fungible Memory (NFM) token issuance.
